- [ ] **Two-tier person-context portability.** **Design pass DELIVERED

      [`sessions/2026-07-22-1233-person-context-portability-design.md`](../../sessions/2026-07-22-1233-person-context-portability-design.md)
      — constraints C1–C8 from cited doctrine, an 8-threat pass, candidate
      architectures per leg, argued recommendations (tier-1 filesystem:
      age/sops capsule, decrypt-on-need; tier-2: estate-root private repo +
      wrong-tier gate; tier-1 phone: out of scope app-native, phone-as-
      terminal when needed; tier-2 phone: app memory as a declared, dated
      second system; seam: filesystem canonical, phone derived). Records-
      only; review WARRANTED when it moves to build/doctrine.
  - **D1–D5 RULED 2026-07-23** (plain-language walk-throughs; stamps and
    grounds in the design record §Decision stamps): D1 the capsule rides
    the private estate repo (plaintext-binding reading confirmed); D2+D4
    **full app-plane parity, superseding the design's counsel** — both
    tiers reach phone/web/desktop-app memory as a generated, date-stamped
    profile (grounds recorded: no phone-unique risk; tier-1 already
    transits the provider in filesystem-leg conversations; standing
    memory deletable); D3 ADP enabled and may be load-bearing; D5 the key
    backup lives in the person-level credential home.
  - [ ] **Build the capsule** — encrypt tier-1 into an age capsule with
        per-machine keys, estate-repo carrier (D1), decrypt-on-need
        unlock, key backed up per D5. Gated on writing the
        **tier-classification rule** (what makes a fact tier 1 — a
        doctrine act) and the wrong-tier pre-commit gate (design §5).
  - [ ] **App-plane profile generator** — render the date-stamped
        both-tier profile from the canonical store for the app's
        memory/Projects (D2/D4 parity ruling); define the reconcile
        cadence; the one-directional seam holds (filesystem canonical).
      Original item, for context: both excluded from atelier, both
      must reach every device Mike works from, handled by sensitivity:
      - *Crown-jewels* (health/family/finance/estate map): E2E-encrypted only
        (iCloud ADP or sops/age); **never a plain remote, not even private
        GitHub**; encrypted at rest even locally; device floor (FileVault/
        passcode).
      - *Instance/identity/toolbox* (accounts, venv paths, domains, client-entity
        facts): private but lighter; may tolerate a private store/repo.
      Honest gap: the **iPhone leg has no filesystem mechanism** — the Claude app
      doesn't read `~/.claude`; phone-side is app memory/Projects, a different
      system. This needs a focused design pass, not "a sync problem".
