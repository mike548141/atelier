- [ ] **Code-signing standard across the fleet** (Mike, 2026-07-11) — "how do we
      sign all the code in the various repos". Two distinct layers, deliberately
      split by cost:
      - [ ] **Flip CI from warn to block.** signscan runs `--warn` fleet-wide;
            flipping to blocking (drop `--warn`, make the gh-plane warning an
            error) is Mike's call once the pre-existing scanner debt is cleared
            and every active machine signs. Vigilant mode stays off until then.
            **Gate assessed 2026-07-12 (session 47), corrected same day by the
            post-session self-review — not met, and the blockers are the
            owners', not the main line's.** None of the three red children fails
            on *signing* (~~so the flip wouldn't newly-red them~~ — **corrected
            2026-07-19, see below**; but the fleet isn't clean enough to declare
            enforce-mode honestly): two fail
            secretscan on owner-tracked secret debt (the principal's rotations,
            session 39's owed list); the third is red on **both** its bespoke CI
            (lint + a test error, agent-actionable, separate cleanup) **and**
            its floor (leakscan findings). Which child is which lives in their
            own private records, not here (RECORD's name × debt join).
            **Retraction:** this session first published a claim that session 41
            had "mis-filed" the third child's redness as scanner debt — that
            claim was built on a `--limit 1` run query that happened to catch
            the bespoke CI workflow; the floor workflow is red too, session 41's
            filing was accurate, and the accusation is withdrawn. On the two
            secret-debt children signscan never runs (secretscan fails first).
            The **"every active machine signs"** half is also unverified. Flip
            held — Mike's call + Mike's action (the rotations). **Hold
            re-confirmed by Mike 2026-07-23** (offered a scheduled rotation
            sitting; chose hold-as-is).
            **Correction 2026-07-19 — "wouldn't newly-red them" was wrong; the
            greens proved nothing** (under `--warn` no floor can *fail* on
            signing, and on scanner-red children the signing steps never run).
            **Before flipping, run `tools/signfleet.py`** — built this session
            for exactly this question. First run: **10 pass, 2 fail, both
            currently green**. Seven unsigned commits from two causes, neither a
            second machine: a boundary set too early, and five replayed by a
            **rebase-merge** (`gh pr merge --rebase`; merges here are agent-run)
            which re-commits server-side, stripping signatures — a recurring
            hazard, since squash/merge-commit are web-flow-signed and it is not.
            Evidence chain in the session record. **Applied (principal's call):
            both boundaries corrected (signfleet 12/12) and
            `allow_rebase_merge` disabled on all 13 repos — shut server-side
            rather than left to each session to remember; merge-commit + squash
            remain, local rebase unaffected, reversible.** Remaining blocker:
            the scanner debt. "Every active machine signs" stays unverified, but
            the drift behind that doubt is explained and is **not** a machine.
      - [ ] **Release-artifact signing + SBOM (deferred, was A5).** Signing *built
            artifacts* + a deterministic SBOM needs external tooling (syft/cosign),
            which hits the tool-install floor and breaks the zero-dep house-tool
            pattern — a deliberate design call, not a build. Revisit when a real
            *release* (a published package/binary) needs provenance; GitHub's
            native artifact attestations are the lightest route if so. Now also
            recorded as SIGNING.md's layer 2 with the same stated trigger.
  - [ ] **C5 backlog strand**: `tools/scaffold.py` (mechanise the
        seed/rename/stamp core; skill becomes its wrapper) — only if a stamp
        defect recurs despite step 5's new mechanical prove-the-stamp.
