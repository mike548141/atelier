# Cold pass — the mandate-versus-default date rule in GUARDS.md

**Pass type:** doctrine cold pass, per `docs/method/REVIEW.md` rule 4.
**Tier:** Fable (the principal-named review tier, ruling 2026-08-04), checked at
selection: this pass's reviewer and orchestrator are both `claude-fable-5-1`.
**Status:** BRIEF WRITTEN 2026-10-03 0357 UTC; the review runs under the
orchestration below, by a reviewer that is not the brief-writer.
**Queue pointer:** `docs/roadmap/160-doctrine-review-owed/450-rule-4-cold-pass-queued-the-date-kind-rule.md`.
**Why it earns a review:** a dated deferment is how every guard's allowance expires; a rule about who may move that date decides whether a child can quietly extend an exemption the house set.

## Spawn provenance

- **Author of the work under review:** the 2026-10-03 queue run (an Opus
  orchestrator with dispatched workers) that landed the commits named under
  *What the work is*. This brief-writer was not that session, was neither
  started nor instructed by it, and has edited none of the delta's paths.
- **Who wrote this brief:** an atelier session Mike opened on 2026-10-03 with
  the prompt "Do all cold reviews and any other work dependent on fable", on
  the Fable tier (`claude-fable-5-1`), orchestrating six rule-4 passes queued
  by that run. It wrote this brief from the queue pointer, the landing commits'
  subjects and `--stat` file lists, and the delta paths' names; it did not open
  the intent record.
- **Who takes the review:** a fresh Fable subagent (`claude-fable-5-1`) spawned
  by the brief-writer with this brief as its only framing. It is not the
  author's session and was not instructed by the author. The reviewer repeats
  its own provenance in the verdict.
- **Orchestration shape, disclosed per rule 4:** reviewer-plus-orchestrator. The
  orchestrator holds the `.deferred.md` sibling outside the worktree and
  outside the harness scratchpad (subagents can read the scratchpad), commits
  the reviewer's phase-1 findings unrevised, then releases the sibling's text by
  message; the reviewer appends a reconcile section; the orchestrator folds the
  sibling in and updates the pointer. The orchestrator forms no finding and
  writes no severity. Both seats are Fable, so the off-tier clause is not
  invoked; the shape is stated anyway so the record is auditable.
- ⚠️ **Brief-writer's exposure, disclosed** (rule-2 material it met before
  writing): the authoring run told this session over the cross-session channel
  that the pointer existed and named its subject in a phrase; nothing else from
  that run was read. Earlier in the same sitting this session commissioned
  read-only inventories of the board's open items and of every verdict in
  `docs/reviews/`, for a ruling round; the summaries it received include prior
  findings on the surfaces under review. Those summaries are author-side
  framing this pass must meet cold; every line of them that bears on this delta
  has been moved to the sibling and kept out of this brief. The brief-writer
  also read the 2026-09-25 batch's staged-plane brief as a formatting template,
  the session index entries of 2026-09-19 to 2026-10-01, and, as doctrine at
  onramp, `docs/method/REVIEW.md`, `docs/method/00-APEX.md` and
  `docs/method/COMMUNICATION.md` § *Asking for a ruling* at HEAD.

## What the work is

Landing commits (diff these; review the paths at HEAD, `17c75a9` or later):

- `f54ae72` (2026-10-03) — guards: a fleet date names its kind — mandate binds, default seeds (board `040/010`)

Delta paths:

- `docs/method/GUARDS.md` — the new subsection *Who may move a deferment's date: mandate or default*, under § *Acceptance and deferment are different things*

No tool, template or other doctrine file changed in the landing commit; whether any of them should have is yours to establish.

## Scope

Widest the work admits: intent, decisions, assumptions, design, docs, code,
tests and live behaviour. The lenses organise it; they do not bound it.
Non-goals are the only narrowing and are themselves reviewable.

Read the subsection against the whole of `GUARDS.md` and every surface that carries a `review-by` or expiry date: `tools/floor.py`'s handling of declared dates, the scanners' allow-marker expiry if any, `.atelier-floor.json`, `PROPAGATION.md`'s floor block, the child `CLAUDE.md` template, and the board legend. Where the rule quotes the principal, check that the quoted words and the surrounding paraphrase say the same thing. Find a live dated allowance in this repo and walk it through the rule: which kind is it, who may move it, and does any tool enforce that. **Non-goal:** whether the principal's rule is right.

## The four lenses

1. **Approach & assumptions.** Name the load-bearing assumptions yourself. The rule presumes every fleet date can be classed as one of two kinds: find the date that is neither, or both. It presumes a child can tell which kind a date is: find where that is undeclared.
2. **Correctness & quality.** Read the subsection and the section it sits under in full. Does the new text contradict, duplicate or silently narrow anything else in `GUARDS.md` or in the docs it points at? Does it name a home for the declaration it requires?
3. **Completeness / harvest.** Every surface that states date semantics for allowances and deferments: list them and check each at HEAD against the new rule. Does `CHANGELOG.md` carry it? Does any guard read the kind?
4. **Security & privacy** — mandatory. A rule about who may extend an exemption is a security control. Check the failure direction: if a child mis-classes a mandate as a default, what guard notices? The house scanner is discharged by grounds (landed delta; the pending diff is this brief) — say so, and deliver the read by hand.

## Re-run obligation

Re-run, do not read. A recorded proof is a claim that can be stale at the commit
that recorded it; a proof you have not re-run is not one you can close on. Lift
floor invocations from `.githooks/pre-commit`, `tools/floor.py` and
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` rather than guessing.

- the floor on both planes at HEAD (doctrine delta; no code to drive)
- `python3 tools/floor.py --selftest` and a grep of `tools/` for date and expiry handling, to ground the sweep in lens 3

## House rules for this run

- You work in the shared review worktree `/Users/mike/worktrees/atelier-review-430`
  (branch `review-430-1003`), read-only except for THIS brief file. Other
  reviewers are working there at the same time on their own briefs; never open
  another `docs/reviews/2026-10-03-*` file — it is another pass's framing. Run
  **no git command that writes** there (no add, commit, stash, checkout,
  worktree, reset, clean). Read-only git (`log`, `show`, `diff`, `blame`) is
  fine. Mutation probes, scratch children and checkouts of older commits go in
  your own clone: `git clone /Users/mike/worktrees/atelier-review-430
  <scratchpad>/DK/probe` under the session scratchpad, named by your
  prefix so parallel reviewers do not collide.
- One heavy process at a time on this machine: run the full suite at most once,
  in the foreground with a long timeout; if a memory-probe test times out, note
  it as environmental and re-run that test file alone before recording it.
  Never scan any tree outside the worktree or your scratch clone, and never
  point a scanner at the machine's other repos. Other sessions are live on this
  machine and in this repo's primary checkout; touch nothing there.
- `/security-review` is **discharged by grounds**: it reads the session's
  pending diff, which here is other passes' drafts and this brief, and this is a
  landed-delta review. State that line in your lens-4 answer and deliver the
  code-altitude read by hand.
- Dates in your verdict are absolute ISO-8601 from `date -u` (the hook-plane
  `datescan` reds relative words such as "yesterday" or "next week" and would
  block the orchestrator's commit). Wrap prose at ≤ 100 columns. NZ English.
  Never quote a secret, a placeholder token, an email address, a private
  repo's name or any personal detail — this repo is PUBLIC; describe, don't
  quote.
- Review deep, not fast. A finding needs a probe or a re-driven claim behind it,
  not reasoning alone; a clean lens needs the trail that earned it.

## Deferred reading — do not open before your findings are durably written
<!-- reviewscan:allow:deferral: this section BARS reading and carries no deferred content — the deferred material lives in the sibling .deferred.md, held by the orchestrator outside the worktree under the rule-1 split and released only after the reviewer's phase-1 findings are committed -->

Rule 2 bars until phase 2: `docs/ROADMAP-DONE.md`, `docs/SESSIONS.md`,
`docs/sessions/`, every prior verdict in `docs/reviews/`, the queue pointer
`docs/roadmap/160-doctrine-review-owed/450-rule-4-cold-pass-queued-the-date-kind-rule.md`
(it carries the author's framing and this pass's claim line), and:

- `docs/sessions/2026-10-03-0144-queue-run-handups-and-tool-defects.md` (the
  intent record)
- the board item `docs/roadmap/040-*/010-*.md` (the commission, carrying the principal's words in context)
- `docs/roadmap/020-*/170-*.md` and `docs/roadmap/115-*/120-*.md` (prior GUARDS.md rulings' outcome lines)

Sweep with `python3 tools/coldsweep.py --root
/Users/mike/worktrees/atelier-review-430 --also-exclude
docs/roadmap/160-doctrine-review-owed/450-rule-4-cold-pass-queued-the-date-kind-rule.md

default bar plus the items above; `--include-barred` only with disclosure in
the verdict. Reading the *delta* is never barred: the code, its tests, the
README entries and the registry are the subject. What is barred is the author's
narrative of why, and the verdicts that recorded it.

## Process

**Phase 1.** Reproduce the floor first; work the lenses and the re-run list.
Then append your verdict below a `---` divider in THIS file: provenance repeated
(how you were spawned, your tier, what you read), per-lens answers, findings
with stable IDs (prefix `DK`: `DK1`, `DK2`, …) and severities
(MAJOR / MODERATE / minor / note), an overall PASS / PASS-WITH-FINDINGS / FAIL
line with counts, a re-run ledger with the commands and their results, and a
follow-up checklist. Then STOP and report to the orchestrator that phase 1 is
written. Do not open the sibling (it is not in the tree); do not edit the queue
pointer, the board, or any file but this one.

**Phase 2.** On receipt of the sibling's text, append `### Reconcile` beneath
your verdict: per-finding notes against the seeded questions and the intent
record, any finding formed at reconcile marked as such, and the overall line
restated. Never revise phase-1 text. The orchestrator folds the sibling in below
your reconcile.

Findings are the principal's to decide (rule 3): record all, apply nothing;
your counsel per finding is welcome, labelled as counsel and kept beneath the
finding.
