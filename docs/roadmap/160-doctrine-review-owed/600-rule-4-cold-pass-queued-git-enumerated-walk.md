- ⏳ **Rule-4 cold pass queued: the file walk enumerates through git
      (`110/110`).** The run authored this itself (its dispatched workers'
      output counts as the run's authorship). It was queued at landing, and
      the run neither takes it nor spawns a reviewer for it. *Tier:* Fable,
      the principal-named review tier, checked at selection. *Pass type:*
      code cold pass, per `method/REVIEW.md` rule 4. *Delta, scoped to
      paths:* `tools/filewalk.py` and `tools/test_filewalk.py`. It landed on
      `main` on 2026-10-03, in merge `bd9bd49`.
      *Intent record:*
      [`../../sessions/2026-10-03-0144-queue-run-handups-and-tool-defects.md`](../../sessions/2026-10-03-0144-queue-run-handups-and-tool-defects.md).
      `[~]` **CLAIMED 2026-10-04 2215 UTC for the review run** (wt: review-1004;
      brief `docs/reviews/2026-10-04-2215-git-enumerated-walk-cold.md`) by a
      Mike-opened `claude-fable-5-1` session ("Do all cold reviews and any other
      work dependent on fable") that authored none of the delta. Shape,
      disclosed per rule 4: reviewer-plus-orchestrator, both seats Fable — this
      session writes the refs-only brief and holds the `.deferred.md` sibling
      outside the worktree; a fresh Fable subagent it spawns forms every finding
      and severity. The sibling, the intent record and prior verdicts stay
      unopened by the reviewer until its phase-1 findings are committed.
      Provenance and exposure go in the verdict.
