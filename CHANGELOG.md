# Changelog

All notable changes to atelier. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/);
newest first. Everything stays under _Unreleased_ until there's a reason to tag.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial scaffold: the `method/` layer stands up first.
- `docs/method/00-APEX.md` — honesty is absolute, then the AI-adapted Three
  Laws (extracted from ros `docs/PRINCIPLES.md` §0, generalised estate-wide).
- `docs/method/AUTONOMY.md` — per-repo autonomy framework; reconciles the
  ros (commit-only) vs faves (commit + push, deploy-on-push) grants.
- `docs/method/STORAGE.md` — GitHub master / iCloud backup / Time Machine→NAS
  whole-machine / laptop disposable; keep churn (venvs, caches, worktrees) out
  of iCloud.
- `docs/method/CONCURRENCY.md` — one worktree per line of work; serialise
  real-world side-effects.
- `docs/method/TOOLBOX.md` — keep a tool manifest; approved-but-missing may be
  installed; the personal inventory stays machine-local, not in this repo.
- README, CLAUDE onramp, LICENSE (Apache-2.0), house `.gitignore` +
  `.claude/settings.json`.

### Pending (see ROADMAP)
- `PRINCIPLES.md` spine and `MODEL-ECONOMICS.md` extraction from ros.
- The `build/` layer: the `create-repo` standard + templates.
- `create-repo` rewired to inherit from atelier instead of copying empty
  templates.
