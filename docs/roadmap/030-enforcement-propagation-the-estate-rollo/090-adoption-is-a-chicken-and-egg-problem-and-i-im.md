- [ ] **Adoption is a chicken-and-egg problem and I improvised twice.** A repo
      whose existing content already fails the gate **cannot commit the change
      that installs the gate**. It happened on two repos and I resolved it with a
      one-time `--no-verify`, documented in each commit — defensible once, but it
      is now an undocumented pattern that will recur on *every* future adoption
      (including the 3 public repos, if adopted). Idea: a documented adoption
      path — either a sanctioned one-time bootstrap, or an `--adopt` mode that
      installs the hygiene checks advisory-first and tightens once the repo
      re-baselines. **Decide the pattern before the next adoption, not during
      it.**
