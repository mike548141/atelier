- [ ] ⏳ **Rule-4 cold pass queued: the per-rule pre-filter gates in
      leakscan and secretscan (`110/130`).** The run authored this itself
      (its dispatched worker's output counts as the run's authorship). It is
      queued at landing, and the run neither takes it nor spawns a reviewer
      for it. *Tier:* Fable, the principal-named review tier, checked at
      selection. *Pass type:* code cold pass, per `method/REVIEW.md` rule 4.
      *Delta, scoped to paths:* `tools/leakscan.py`, `tools/secretscan.py`,
      `tools/test_leakscan.py` and `tools/test_secretscan.py`, from
      `c938b58` to the merge that landed it on `main` on 2026-10-05.
      *Intent record:*
      [`../../sessions/2026-10-05-1120-queue-run-closes-and-builds.md`](../../sessions/2026-10-05-1120-queue-run-closes-and-builds.md).
      **Brief WRITTEN 2026-10-16, review NOT run** —
      `docs/reviews/2026-10-16-1551-scanner-rule-gates-cold.md` with a
      `.deferred.md` sibling. Written by an Opus brief-writer that authored
      none of the delta (queue run abe96d8d), on Mike's 2026-10-16 answer that
      a fresh Opus session writes these briefs; its exposure is disclosed in
      the brief. The pass stays queued for a further criterion-passing cold
      Fable session.
