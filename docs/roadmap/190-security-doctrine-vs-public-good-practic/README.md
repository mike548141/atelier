# Security doctrine vs public good practice — gap analysis (Mike, 2026-07-22)

Mike's directive during the SECRETS.md access-management session: *"take into
account any publicly available good practice for security that we should build
into the doctrine"* — OWASP named, the NCSC developers collection linked, and a
secure-SDLC checklist pasted (threat modelling/STRIDE, secure defaults, least
privilege, secure coding, secrets management, supply-chain checks, automated
scanning, peer review, continuous learning). The *credentials* slice landed
same-session (SECRETS.md "Grounding in public practice", `caa85fe` — NIST SP
800-63B rev 4 + OWASP secrets cheat sheet, corroboration named, the one
divergence owned). The rest is a doctrine-wide sweep, deliberately not crammed
into that delta:

Mapping done 2026-07-22 (record:
[`sessions/2026-07-22-1025-security-canon-gap-map.md`](../../sessions/2026-07-22-1025-security-canon-gap-map.md)
— A/B/E confirmed narrow, C reframed to mutable-tag CI actions, D dismissed
instance-layer) → [`ROADMAP-DONE.md`](../../ROADMAP-DONE.md).

- **Already held — name, don't rebuild** (verified by the mapping,
  2026-07-22): automated scanning in the pipeline (the floor scanners), peer
  review before ship (REVIEW.md), least privilege (SECRETS triad), secrets
  never in source (right plane), repo protection (ADR 0007 signing + the
  floor — active since 2026-07-12 per SIGNING.md), incident learning (the
  harvest loop; the anti-slop *promotion rule* is a capture below, not yet
  doctrine — the original list overclaimed it, corrected 2026-07-22), clean
  maintainable code (PRINCIPLES).

*review: WARRANTED when the mapping moves to doctrine edits; the capture
itself is records-only.*
