# Cold pass — harvestscan's prefix-filter rewrite — the similarity pass indexed, exact and bounded

**Pass type:** code cold pass, per `docs/method/REVIEW.md` rule 4.
**Tier:** Fable (the principal-named review tier, ruling 2026-08-04), checked at
selection: this batch's reviewer and orchestrator are both `claude-fable-5-1`.
**Status:** BRIEF WRITTEN 2026-09-25 UTC; the review runs in the same batch
under the orchestration below, by a reviewer that is not the brief-writer.
**Queue pointer:**
`docs/roadmap/160-doctrine-review-owed/400-rule-4-cold-pass-queued-the-harvestscan-prefix-filter.md`.
**Why it earns a review:** a warn-only guard whose fast path silently drops a
true positive never tells anyone; the rewrite rests on a mathematical claim
(exactness) that, if off by one, converts a quadratic-but-correct guard into a
linear-and-wrong one.

## Spawn provenance

- **Author of the work under review:** the session(s) that landed the commits
  named under *What the work is*. This brief-writer was not that session, was
  neither started nor instructed by it, and has edited none of the delta's
  paths.
- **Who wrote this brief:** an atelier session Mike opened on 2026-09-20 and
  re-pointed on 2026-09-24 with the prompt "Please deliver all fable dependent
  work, and work that would be best delivered using fable", on the Fable tier
  (`claude-fable-5-1`), orchestrating this batch of twenty rule-4 passes. It
  wrote this brief from the queue pointer, the landing commits' subjects and
  file lists, and the delta paths' names; it did not open the intent record or
  any prior verdict on these surfaces.
- **Who takes the review:** a fresh Fable subagent (`claude-fable-5-1`) spawned
  by the brief-writer with this brief as its only framing. It is not the
  author's session and was not instructed by the author. The reviewer repeats
  its own provenance in the verdict.
- **Orchestration shape, disclosed per rule 4:** reviewer-plus-orchestrator. The
  orchestrator holds the `.deferred.md` sibling outside the worktree, commits
  the reviewer's phase-1 findings unrevised, then releases the sibling's text by
  message; the reviewer appends a reconcile section; the orchestrator folds the
  sibling in and updates the pointer. The orchestrator forms no finding and
  writes no severity. Both seats are Fable, so the off-tier clause is not
  invoked; the shape is stated anyway so the record is auditable.
- ⚠️ **Brief-writer's exposure, disclosed** (rule-2 material it met before
  writing): the `docs/SESSIONS.md` index entries of 2026-09-11 to 2026-09-19
  (the last three summarise the 2026-09-18 and 2026-09-19 runs in the authors'
  words); the first 30 lines and the last ~3,000 characters of
  `docs/sessions/2026-09-20-1053-queue-run-the-loose-ends.md`, read during an
  interrupted-session sweep on 2026-09-20; every queued `⏳` pointer on the board
  in full, including each pointer's own "lens that matters" paragraph — that
  paragraph is the author's framing and has been moved to this pass's sibling;
  the pass file `docs/reviews/2026-08-17-1000-coldsweep-cold.md` in full (brief
  and verdict) and lines 1–80 of
  `docs/reviews/2026-08-21-0820-pointing-up-cold.md`, both as formatting
  templates; the landing commits' subjects and `--stat` file lists (never the
  diffs); and, as doctrine read at onramp, `docs/method/CONCURRENCY.md` §§ *On a
  split board*, *Claiming at a dirty primary checkout* and *Surviving an
  interrupted session*, `docs/method/REVIEW.md` and `docs/method/00-APEX.md` at
  HEAD. Per-pass additions are marked ⚠️ under *Deferred reading*.

## What the work is

Landing commits (diff these; review the paths at HEAD):

- `ea8d50b` / `82d0314` (2026-09-20) — the landing commits

Delta paths:

- `tools/harvestscan.py` — `_build_survivor_index`, `_candidate_bucket`, and
  `vanished`'s inlined containment
- `tools/test_harvestscan.py` — the `BoundedTime` class
- `tools/README.md` § *harvestscan*

## Scope

Widest the work admits: intent, decisions, assumptions, design, docs, code,
tests and live behaviour. The lenses organise it; they do not bound it.
Non-goals are the only narrowing and are themselves reviewable.

The exactness claim, independently: state the pigeonhole argument in your own
words from the code, derive the bucket size from `SURVIVAL_SIMILARITY` and `n`,
and test it — build fingerprints at every `n` from 1 to 40 and a survivor at
exactly the threshold containment, one word below, and one above, and show the
fast path agrees with a brute-force `similarity()` on all of them (a property
test, not a sample). The inlined formula against `similarity()`: are they the
same function on every input, including empty sets and duplicates? The
`BoundedTime` ceilings: grounded in the input class or fitted to a machine? The
replay claim: how many commits were actually compared, and is "byte-identical on
749 commits" the same claim as "byte-identical on 9 in scope"? **Non-goal:** the
commissioning item.

## The four lenses

1. **Approach & assumptions.** Name the load-bearing assumptions yourself. The
   whole review is whether *exact* is true; treat the README's statement of it
   as the author's claim.
2. **Correctness & quality.** Read the whole tool. Run `--selftest` and
   `tools.test_harvestscan`. Write the property test in your scratch clone and
   record its result and its inputs. Check the rounding in `k` at every `n`
   where `0.6 n` is an integer or just below one.
3. **Completeness / harvest.** Does anything else call `similarity()` or
   duplicate its formula? Does the README say what the guard now cannot see, if
   anything? Is the quadratic `020/400` class closed for *every* pass in the
   tool, or one?
4. **Security & privacy** — mandatory. The tool reads git history via subprocess
   and compares roadmap text; check its argument handling and that its output
   cannot leak a private item's text from a child's history into a public log
   beyond what the warn line already shows. The house scanner is discharged by
   grounds (landed delta; pending = other passes' drafts) — say so, and deliver
   the code-altitude read by hand.

## Re-run obligation

Re-run, do not read. A recorded proof is a claim that can be stale at the commit
that recorded it; a proof you have not re-run is not one you can close on. Lift
floor invocations from `.githooks/pre-commit`, `tools/floor.py` and
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` rather than guessing.

- `python3 tools/harvestscan.py --selftest`; `python3 -m unittest
  tools.test_harvestscan`; the full Python suite once
- the property test in *Scope*, with inputs recorded so it can be re-run
- the replay: run the tool over this repo's history the way the landing commit's
  tests do and record the counts
- the floor on both planes at HEAD

## House rules for this run

- You work in the shared review worktree
  `/Users/mike/worktrees/atelier-review-batch-0925` (branch
  `review-batch-0925`), read-only except for THIS brief file. Other reviewers
  are working there at the same time on their own briefs; never open another
  `docs/reviews/2026-09-25-0715-*` file — it is another pass's framing.
- Run **no git command that writes** in the worktree (no add, commit, stash,
  checkout, worktree, reset, clean). Read-only git (`log`, `show`, `diff`,
  `blame`, `branch -r`) is fine. Mutation probes, checkouts of older commits,
  scratch children and scratch linked worktrees go in your own clone: `git clone
  <worktree> <scratchpad>/<PREFIX>/probe` under the session scratchpad, named by
  your prefix so parallel reviewers do not collide.
- One heavy process at a time on this machine: run the full Python suite
  (`python3 -m unittest discover -s tools`, in the foreground, ~minutes) at most
  once, never scan any tree outside the worktree or your scratch clone, and
  never point a scanner at the machine's other repos.
- `/security-review` is **discharged by grounds** for this batch: it reads the
  session's pending diff, which in the shared worktree is other passes' unstaged
  drafts, and this is a landed-delta review. State that line in your lens-4
  answer and deliver the code-altitude read by hand, checked against the OWASP
  catalogue where the work has a code surface.
- Dates in your verdict are absolute ISO-8601 from `date -u` (the hook-plane
  `datescan` reds relative words such as "yesterday" or "next week" tree-wide,
  and would block the orchestrator's commit). Wrap prose at ≤ 100 columns. NZ
  English. Never quote a secret, a placeholder token, an email address or any
  personal detail — this repo is PUBLIC; describe, don't quote.
- Review deep, not fast. A finding needs a probe or a re-driven claim behind it,
  not reasoning alone; a clean lens needs the trail that earned it.

## Deferred reading — do not open before your findings are durably written
<!-- reviewscan:allow:deferral: this section BARS reading and carries no deferred content — the deferred material lives in the sibling .deferred.md, held by the orchestrator outside the worktree under the rule-1 split and released only after the reviewer's phase-1 findings are committed -->

Rule 2 bars until phase 2: `docs/ROADMAP-DONE.md`, `docs/SESSIONS.md`,
`docs/sessions/`, every prior verdict in `docs/reviews/`, the queue pointer
`docs/roadmap/160-doctrine-review-owed/400-rule-4-cold-pass-queued-the-harvestscan-prefix-filter.md`
(it carries the author's own lens hints), and:

- `docs/sessions/2026-09-20-1053-queue-run-the-loose-ends.md` (⚠️ head and tail
  read by the brief-writer; the `020/400` section not opened)
- the board items `docs/roadmap/020-*/400-*.md`, `docs/roadmap/115-*/080-*.md`

Sweep with `python3 tools/coldsweep.py --root
/Users/mike/worktrees/atelier-review-batch-0925 --also-exclude
docs/roadmap/160-doctrine-review-owed/400-rule-4-cold-pass-queued-the-harvestscan-prefix-filter.md
<pattern>` — rule 2's default bar, plus `--also-exclude` for the items above;
`--include-barred` only with disclosure in the verdict. Reading the *delta* is
never barred: the code, its tests, the doctrine text and the catalogue entries
are the subject. What is barred is the author's narrative of why, and the
verdicts that recorded it.

## Process

**Phase 1.** Reproduce the floor first; work the lenses and the re-run list.
Then append your verdict below a `---` divider in THIS file: provenance repeated
(how you were spawned, your tier, what you read), per-lens answers, findings
with stable IDs (prefix `HP`: `HP1`, `HP2`, …) and severities (MAJOR / MODERATE
/ minor / note), an overall PASS / PASS-WITH-FINDINGS / FAIL line with counts, a
re-run ledger with the commands and their results, and a follow-up checklist.
Then STOP and report to the orchestrator that phase 1 is written. Do not open
the sibling (it is not in the tree); do not edit the queue pointer, the board,
or any file but this one.

**Phase 2.** On receipt of the sibling's text, append `### Reconcile` beneath
your verdict: per-finding notes against the seeded questions and the intent
records, any finding formed at reconcile marked as such, and the overall line
restated. Never revise phase-1 text. The orchestrator folds the sibling in below
your reconcile.

The author is not the taker, so record every finding and apply nothing; counsel
on fixes is welcome, labelled as counsel.
