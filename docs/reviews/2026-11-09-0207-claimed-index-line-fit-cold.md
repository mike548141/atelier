# Cold pass — the claimed index line fitted to wrapscan, and brackets neutralised in titles

**Pass type:** code cold pass, per `docs/method/REVIEW.md` rule 4 (a guard or a rule is doctrine by
function, rule 3).
**Tier:** Fable 5.1, the principal-named review tier, checked at selection by whoever takes the
pass. A session that cannot run on it stops (rule 4).
**Status:** BRIEF ONLY, not run. Written 2026-11-09 UTC by session `d4a0fcf3`, a headless Opus 5.5
brief-writer. The pass is held for the principal's explicit approval of Fable work; this brief is
not that approval.
**Queue pointer:**
`docs/roadmap/160-doctrine-review-owed/985-rule-4-cold-pass-queued-claimed-index-line-fit.md`.
**Size of this pass:** small: one commit, about 75 lines of `tools/board.py` and its tests.
**Why it earns a review:** `board.py` is a guard every child runs, and its index is what a queue run
reads to choose work. The worst failure is silent: an index line that misstates who holds an item,
or a title whose link breaks, read as fact by the next session.

## Spawn provenance

- **Author of the work under review:** a principal-opened Opus 5.5 queue run, session `4c65083c`,
  2026-11-03, and the Sonnet worker it dispatched, which wrote the code (per the queue pointer). The
  author queued this pass and does not take it.
- **Who wrote this brief:** session `d4a0fcf3` (`claude-opus-5-5`), a headless brief-writer started
  2026-11-09 UTC by coordinating session `74f2b8cd` (Opus 5.5), on the principal's request to brief
  every owed pass. Neither wrote any of this delta. **Off-tier for review, disclosed: the
  brief-writer forms no finding and writes no severity**, and stops after writing. It ran no review
  and used no Fable model. `74f2b8cd` built none of these subjects and forms no finding; its launch
  prompt is the brief-writer's only instruction.
- **Barred from running this pass:** session `d4a0fcf3` and session `74f2b8cd` (whoever writes a
  brief does not run it, the principal's rule), and the author session named above with everything
  it started.
- **Contact, disclosed (rule 4):** the brief-writer's only instruction came from `74f2b8cd`: the
  item numbers, the rules of the run, and the statement that it built none of these subjects. It
  carried no framing of the work. The brief-writer had no contact with the author session or its
  workers.
- **Who reviews:** a fresh Fable 5.1 session started for this pass alone, by a session that passes
  rule 4's criterion. An orchestrator may hold the context partition and commit the records
  off-tier, only if it forms no finding, writes no severity, and is disclosed in the claim, the
  pointer and the verdict.
- ⚠️ **Brief-writer's exposure, disclosed** (rule-2 and author-account material met before writing):
  its launch prompt; `skills/review-brief/SKILL.md` and `docs/method/REVIEW.md` whole; the board
  item whole; the intent records' opening part and every line naming the principal or a landing
  account; every delta commit body-free through `tools/coldsweep.py --commit`; commit subjects
  through `git log`; `docs/reviews/2026-11-06-2027-secretscan-public-pem-spans-cold.md` whole,
  **including that pass's verdict and folded sibling** (a different subject, read for house form),
  the acceptance-test section and the status and overall verdict lines of
  `docs/reviews/2026-10-26-0928-g3-grace-metadata-sets-cold.md` (the counts only), and the opening
  30 lines of board item `160/980`; three lines of `docs/SESSIONS.md` and the opening of
  `docs/sessions/2026-11-06-2022-fable-passes-850e.md`; the results of the re-run lines below. It
  did **not** open any other prior verdict or any delta commit's message body. Its harness also
  loaded user-level and repo instruction files and a memory index, which hold private context this
  brief does not carry. Everything evaluative it formed is in the sibling.

## The acceptance test

No record the brief-writer read carries a ruling of the principal's on this design. Judge the delta
against what the index is for: `docs/roadmap/README.md` and the `board.py` module docstring, and
`wrapscan`'s stated limit and single-token exemption in `tools/README.md`.

## What the work is

- **`10e2cc5`** — `board: fit a claimed item's index line to wrapscan and neutralise brackets in
  titles`.

Delta paths, read at each commit and at HEAD:

- `tools/board.py`, `tools/test_board.py`, `CHANGELOG.md`

First confirm the tree holds the delta, then read each commit body-free:

```
git merge-base --is-ancestor 10e2cc5 HEAD; echo $?
python3 tools/coldsweep.py --root . --commit <sha> --path tools/board.py --path tools/test_board.py
```

Plain `git show` is barred: it prints the message body before the diff, and reading is atomic (rule
1). The commit also touches board records; those are barred until phase 2, so always pass `--path`.

Then see what has landed on those paths since, and read anything new the same way, only as far as it
bears on this delta at HEAD: `git log --oneline 10e2cc5..HEAD -- tools/board.py
tools/test_board.py`.

## The claims the delta makes

Extracted from the delta, not evaluated here. They are the author's claims to test, not settled
scope. Name your own load-bearing assumptions first (lens 1).

- `WRAP_COLS = 85` is "the width at which `wrapscan` stops reading a line as prose"; a claimed line
  "passes while no whitespace sits past this column" (comment above `WRAP_COLS`).
- A claim is shortened "only as far as the line needs", in a stated order; "who has it" stays on the
  line, and a name that cannot be cut to 8 columns "is left whole and the line overruns; it is rare
  and stated, not hidden" (`_claim_for_index`).
- `_fit_title` is "a no-op for an unclaimed line" (comment at its call site in `index_line`).
- `[` and `]` as character references are "safe inside `[...]`" and give "no scanner a bracket to
  read" (`_escape_link_text`).
- The legacy projection stays "byte-identical" (`index_title`'s docstring).
- The `CHANGELOG.md` entry for this commit, whatever it states for children.

## Scope

The widest the work admits: intent, decisions, assumptions, design, docs, code, test code and live
behaviour. The lenses organise it; they do not bound it. Anything not named a non-goal is in scope,
and a non-goal that fences off the risk is a finding.

**Non-goals:** `320/450` §3 (the §10 declaration's home) and `010/130` (wrapscan's scope), except
where this delta's claims rest on them; the `010/200` sort (pass `160/987`).

## The four lenses

1. **Approach & assumptions.** Name the load-bearing assumptions yourself, before anything else. Is
   this the right problem, solved at the right altitude and in the right shape, against the
   acceptance test?
2. **Correctness & quality.** Re-drive the claims above. Record each overclaim against the text that
   makes it.
3. **Completeness / harvest.** Every surface that states this behaviour (V3); one home (V4); no
   contradiction (V5). Find tests that would stay green on a broken delta by mutating a scratch
   copy.
4. **Security & privacy**, mandatory: at design altitude what this exposes, over-collects or leaks
   by weakness of design; at code altitude the likely vectors for its class, checked against an open
   catalogue (OWASP ASVS or the domain's equivalent). Aim `/security-review` at code only from a
   clean tree, as *House rules* says; weigh a clean pass over markdown as nothing.

Run the standing checklist V1–V7 unasked (`REVIEW.md` § *The standing checklist*).

## Re-run obligation

Re-run, do not read. The brief-writer ran each line once, on 2026-11-09 UTC, from the worktree root,
in the foreground or under `nice`; its results are held in the sibling. Read exit codes explicitly.
Check `uptime` first and run the heavy lines under `nice -n 10`. Use the `python3` first on the
machine's `PATH`.

```
python3 -m unittest discover -s tools -p test_board.py
python3 tools/board.py --selftest
python3 tools/board.py --check
python3 tools/wrapscan.py --root . docs/ROADMAP.md
nice -n 10 python3 -m unittest discover -s tools
```

## House rules for this run

- **Live systems:** read-only reads of live systems as needed; no live writes. A check that needs a
  write is marked NOT RUN, with why. No push, no write to GitHub, no network service changed.
- **Never print a secret** or any personal data. Probes use scratch copies and synthetic fixtures
  under your scratchpad, deleted when you finish.
- Name your own review worktree in the verdict. It is read-only to you except for THIS file. Other
  sessions may be live on this machine: touch nothing outside your worktree and scratchpad. Child
  repos are read-only and reported by count only, never by name or path.
- One heavy process at a time, foreground, with a long timeout. Never run an installed tool by bare
  name from `PATH`: use `python3 tools/<x>.py` or `instruments/<x>` from your worktree.
- `/security-review` reads the session's pending diff, not this delta. Aim it at the code by
  reproducing the diff in a scratch clone, or discharge it by grounds and do the code-altitude read
  by hand, never with this brief or its sibling dirty.
- This pass is pending while you run it: anything you write to the session log, the pointer or a
  commit subject before phase 2 names the sibling by file and count only.
- Absolute ISO 8601 dates from `date -u`; prose wrapped at ≤ 100 columns; NZ English. This repo is
  PUBLIC: quote no secret, email address, private repo name or path.
- Review deep, not fast: a finding needs a probe or a re-driven claim behind it.

## Deferred reading — do not open before your findings are durably written
<!-- reviewscan:allow:deferral: this section BARS reading and carries no deferred content; the deferred material lives in the sibling .deferred.md under the rule-1 split, opened only after the reviewer's phase-1 findings are committed -->

Rule 2 bars until phase 2: `docs/ROADMAP-DONE.md`, `docs/SESSIONS.md`, `docs/sessions/`, every prior
verdict in `docs/reviews/`, this brief's sibling
`docs/reviews/2026-11-09-0207-claimed-index-line-fit-cold.deferred.md` (a held-back file; by count:
7 questions, 1 facts), every other item under `docs/roadmap/160-doctrine-review-owed/` beyond its
title, every delta commit's message body, and these intent records beyond their first line:

- `docs/roadmap/320-child-filed-findings-via-pointing-up/730-hand-up-the-paragraph-projection-joins-a-claim-into-an-index-line-wrapscan-refuses.md`
- `docs/roadmap/320-child-filed-findings-via-pointing-up/450-a-wrapped-claim-does-not-project-and-two-more-from-a-child-s-cold-passes.md`

The delta's own docstrings, comments, README, design note and `CHANGELOG.md` entries carry the
author's account of why; they are the delta, and reading the delta is never barred.

Sweep with `coldsweep`, never a hand-written exclusion:

```
python3 tools/coldsweep.py --root <your-worktree> \
  --also-exclude docs/roadmap/160-doctrine-review-owed \
  --also-exclude docs/roadmap/320-child-filed-findings-via-pointing-up/730-hand-up-the-paragraph-projection-joins-a-claim-into-an-index-line-wrapscan-refuses.md \
  --also-exclude docs/roadmap/320-child-filed-findings-via-pointing-up/450-a-wrapped-claim-does-not-project-and-two-more-from-a-child-s-cold-passes.md \
  'WRAP_COLS|TITLE_MIN|_fit_title|_claim_for_index|_escape_link_text'
```

`--include-barred` only with disclosure in the verdict.

## Process

**Phase 1 (act 1).** Reproduce the floor first; work the lenses, your own assumptions and the re-run
list. Append your verdict below a `---` divider in THIS file: provenance repeated (how you were
spawned, your tier, any orchestrator, what you read, the UTC day), per-lens answers, V1–V7 each
answered or discharged with grounds, each load-bearing assumption damaged or confirmed with its
probe, a per-commit ledger (read body-free yes/no, findings by id), findings with stable IDs (prefix
`CX`: `CX1`, `CX2`, …) and severities (MAJOR / MODERATE / minor / note), an overall PASS /
PASS-WITH-FINDINGS / FAIL line with counts, a re-run ledger and a follow-up checklist. Then STOP:
act 1 is committed, unrevised, **before** the sibling is opened. Edit no other file.

**Phase 2 (act 2).** Open the sibling and the barred records; screen the delta's commit bodies;
append `### Reconcile` beneath your verdict, with per-finding notes against the sibling's questions
and the author's account, any finding formed at reconcile marked as such, and the overall line
restated. Never revise act-1 text. Then fold the sibling in below the reconcile and delete it.

The work is doctrine by function, so every finding is the principal's to decide (rule 3): record
all, apply nothing. Counsel per finding is welcome, labelled as counsel and kept beneath it.
